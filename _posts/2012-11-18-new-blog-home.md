subtitle: Maybe I'll update this time?

So, I've deprecated [my old posterous account](http://dfellis.posterous.com) in favor of a GitHub-maintained blog. I wasn't really using any of the features Posterous provides, and Posterous makes it difficult to include source code in posts, which is what I was doing more than 75% of the time.

This way, I also have my posts under version control, I can customize the look/feel however I like, and I don't have to leave the terminal to make a new post, so hopefully I'll be more likely to write updates this time.
