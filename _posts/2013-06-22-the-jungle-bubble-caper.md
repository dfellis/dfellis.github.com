# The Jungle Bubble Caper

Once upon a time, in a jungle far away, a boy named Mike was blowing bubbles for his monkey friends. The monkeys were excited by these bubbles, happy and scared all at once. When Mike blew into the bubble wand, the bubbles seemed to appear in front of his face out of nowhere! Once they were there, though, they floated lazily around, until they popped and disappeared again, and Mike would start again blowing up a new set of bubbles.

Soon, a small gust of wind caught a set of bubbles and flung them around and towards the monkeys! The monkeys became very frightened and the one that was touched by the bubbles cried out and swatted at the rest! ...but nothing bad happened, and the bubbles just popped and disappeared the moment they were touched! Ha ha! The monkeys soon came to delight at being able to pop the bubbles when they pleased, and they stayed to play with Mike much longer that day!

When the day was almost done, Mike put the bubble wand back into his big bubble jug and screwed the cap back on and carried it back to his hut, and left it outside the front door. Inside, Mike's mom gave him mango and chicken and plantains to eat for dinner.

But little did Mike know that John had been watching him from behind some jungle vines the whole time. John was jealous that Mike got to play with the monkeys, since they loved his bubbles. John snuck over to Mike's hut and took his bubble jar! He took out the bubble wand and tried to blow bubbles, but none came out! He didn't know how to blow bubbles.

This made John angry. He wanted to blow bubbles and play with the monkeys, but if he couldn't, then he'd make sure Mike couldn't, too! He took the bubble jar to a bush and poured out all of the bubble juice! Then he returned it to Mike's hut.

But wait, if the bubble jar is empty, Mike's mom or dad will just make more bubble juice and put *that* in the jar. So John had an idea. He took the bubble jar to the river and filled it up with river water, and then brought it back to Mike's hut and then went to his own hut for the night.

The next day
